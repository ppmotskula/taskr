val_100215 BugFix:
My_MagicAbstract::getMagic() caused error when class instance didn't have a _magic array,
like in My_MagicFlex class.

val_100222 NewClass:
My_Dbg is actually a tiny self-initializing tracer.
In the current implementation, it will auto-activate if development mode is detected.
It's interface is not fully finished yet and there is no explicit method to disable it.
If you don't want it, then just specify an non-existent directory in [tracer.path] of
application.ini file.

val_100223 status:
The port to MySQL platform seems to work now, except project features (soon to come!).
The original business class files renamed like 'TaskW.php' are kept in Models directory
for quick reference, but the code itself is not executed.
NB: User save doesn't support 'emailTmp' column yet!

NB: .ini file in application/configs has to be edited manually for actual connection parameters
on deployment! 

There is also My_RmoAbstract class layer switched between business classes and 
My_MagicAbstract class. Let it be there so far - it won't degrade execution and from time to time
I play with it in my private brances.

Only tiny part of My_RmoManager code is actually in use right now and it may well be that
the whole RMO stuff will be kicked out finally.
