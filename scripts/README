This directory contains scripts for setting up taskr databases.

EXECUTABLE SCRIPTS:
  what             - dumps contents of ../application/configs/config.ini
  use <servertype> - modifies config.ini provided that config.<servertype>.ini exists.
  
  These files are necessary only if you really want to switch different databases quickly.
  Otherwise, you can edit configuration files manually.
  
  
  initdb.php       - for initiating new database server.
> php initdb.php -h  will print some helpful information.
                     
  It will look for files schema.<dbtype>.sql and data.<dbtype>.sql first. If these are not found,
  then schema.sql and data.sql will be used, respectively.
  
  <dbtype> will be the value of 'resources.db.adapter' from config file, set to lowercase
  and 'PDO_' prefix stripped, when present.
