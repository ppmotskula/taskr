Taskr - take your time

Taskr is a prototype task manager that helps you stay focused.

Taskr was created in early 2010 by Villem Alango <valango@gmail.com> and
Peeter P. Mõtsküla <peeterpaul@motskula.net> with the dual goal of learning
a couple of new technologies, and possibly launching the resulting product
as a micro-startup company. Over time, the developers' attention shifted to
other projects, and in August, they decided to release the unfinished project's
source code to the public under the new BSD license that follows.
